# Analyzing-Random-Number-Generators-and-Optimism-Pessimism-Dynamics
Assignment 1 delves into random number generators and human behavior models. Implementing GGL, RAN3, and Python's Mersenne-Twister, it scrutinizes generated pairs' distributions and simulates optimism-pessimism dynamics. Explore probability functions' behavior, aiming to uncover underlying patterns in random behavior and human interactions.
